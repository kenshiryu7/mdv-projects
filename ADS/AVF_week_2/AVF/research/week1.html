<p style="color: #FFFF00;padding:2%">1. What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?</p> 

<p style="color:#FFF;padding:2%">You can use many such as camera, video, accelerometer, compass, geo-location, storage ad etc. It's exciting to note this, yet I'm sure there are much more efficient ways of implementing these features without html/css/js only.</p>


<p style="color: #FFFF00;padding:2%">2. For your CRUD app revision, which of these do you think you will implement?</p>

<p style="color:#FFF;padding:2%">My CRUD app is intended for drummers. Perhaps the camera to share shots of their drum sets, or maybe storage if somehow to save audio files of their own recordings.</p>


<p style="color: #FFFF00;padding:2%">3. Briefly describe some past "lesson learned" regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</p>

<p style="color:#FFF;padding:2%">Iv'e learned that if possible, making a sketch of your intended final look helps a lot. Make sure you either back things up or save a copy somewhere. Make files as easy to access as possible by minimizing the trail and also making the file names easy without being to similar to another file name. Start early because debugging is where the hours are spent!</p>


<p style="color: #FFFF00;padding:2%">4. Please describe any design intentions you may have for the AVF Demo app and the revised / new version of your CRUD app.</p>

<p style="color:#FFF;padding:2%">I would like the demo app to be user friendly but also to not stray to far from its main content as far as look or feel which is the main CRUD app. definitely make it as clean and attractive as possible without over doing it. I still need to get my CRUD app completely functional.</p>


<p style="color: #FFFF00;padding:2%">5. If not covered above, please also describe any functionality intentions you may have for both the AVF Demo app and the revised / new version of your CRUD app.</p>

<p style="color:#FFF;padding:2%">I would like to leave things as simple and user friendly as possible. Nothing to distracting but straight to the point of what the app intends.<p>
