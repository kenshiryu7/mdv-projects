<p style="color: #FFFF00;padding:2%">1. What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance.)</p> 

<p style="color:#FFF;padding:2%">Proper use of tags. Especially with header tags and with the section tag for jQuery. In other words made it as simple and linear as possible Without targeting too much on Accessibility. Somewhere in the middle. Mainly if thinking of the visually impaired and the use of a screen reader for example, perhaps making it simple and organized will allow the impaired user to more easily navigate through the site. </p>

<p style="color: #FFFF00;padding:2%">2. Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</p>

<p style="color:#FFF;padding:2%">A few problems that have risen when using a screen reader is a cluttered page. Although the screen reader works properly, the web site itself can become confusing or overwhelming, Especially if links have the same name such as "click here now!" or "click to access" for example. I viewed an example of Thunder Screen Reader which uses a text browser to avoid the clutter and just read words. The translation is where problems may occur occasionally.</p>


<p style="color: #FFFF00;padding:2%">3. Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</p>

<p style="color:#FFF;padding:2%">The first I would list would be of the example listed in question 3. Thunder Screen Reader. It is mainly used in the UK and allows a blind user to access the internet by search commands with a text browser. The screen reader has an audio voice that clearly allows the user to know where they are navigating. Navigation is done through the keyboard and keyboard commands. 

The second would be the iPhone. The iPhone uses voiceover (which uses an audible voice to read on screen menus and items), Large Text (which allows those who are not completely visually impaired to have the option to have an easier time reading larger text)There is also White on Black, Zoom and Mono audio as well. </p>


<p style="color: #FFFF00;padding:2%">4. Mobile Apps" Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</p>

<p style="color:#FFF;padding:2%">Voice Brief:  Similar to Siri on iPhone. This app reads aloud the built in calendar, Weather, News, 		mail notifications, Facebook and twitter, and stocks as well.

Digit-Eyes:  an app that allows visually impaired people to scan barcodes and hear the names of 		what the app states over 23 million products. The barcodes may con taint text which 		uses voiceover within iPhone to read aloud the text.</p>
