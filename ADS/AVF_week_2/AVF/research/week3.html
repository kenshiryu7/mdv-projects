    <p style="color: #FFFF00;padding:2%">1. What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?</p> 
    
    <p style="color:#FFF;padding:2%">I found that for 2011 the top categories were games, weather and social networking.  With games on top. That doesn't seem to far fetched as apps are typically known for games and with Facebook and twitter social networking apps are common place today. </p>
    
    <p style="color: #FFFF00;padding:2%">2. What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?</p>
    
    <p style="color:#FFF;padding:2%">Gaming came out on top in Japan with  Weather, Social networking , maps and news coming after.</p>
    
    
    <p style="color: #FFFF00;padding:2%">3. What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?</p>
    
    <p style="color:#FFF;padding:2%">Great Britain leans towards Weather and News. This is also not surprising as Great Britain has a high rain levels year round and with the world famous BBC news.</p>
    
    
    <p style="color: #FFFF00;padding:2%">4. Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</p>
    
    <p style="color:#FFF;padding:2%">I would say that games are top on the market and probably will be for a long time. The game developing industry sees the market as a huge opportunity to make simple games that are purposely made for a quick 5 minute play or for a long game while on the road. Social networking will continue to evolve as people find or request improved ways to communicate and get their ideas out, and Weather and News must be faster and more thorough with updating their apps.</p>
    
    
    <p style="color: #FFFF00;padding:2%">5. What percentage of Android users have the latest / greatest OS in the US? in Japan? in Great 
    Britain? How might these differences impact development?</p>
    
    <p style="color:#FFF;padding:2%">Only just over one percent of Android users are using their latest OS which is Ice Cream Sandwich. This appears to be world wide. It looks like  Android 2.3.3 gingerbread is still the majority of the market.<p>
    <p><p>
    <p style="color:#FFF;padding:2%">This effects development because Developers will not want to target such a small market. If for example a developer does decide to market on ice cream sandwich, advertisers may not want to jump on board and in todays market in apps, many apps have advertisements within the app or even while in use. <p>
    
    <p style="color: #FFFF00;padding:2%">6.What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</p>
    
        
    <p style="color:#FFF;padding-left:2%">US:   		 $3.33 with 4.8 mbps<p>
    <p style="color:#FFF;padding-left:2%">Japan: 	 $0.27 with 61 mbps<p>
    <p style="color:#FFF;padding-left:2%">Great Britain: $10-20 with about 3mbps<p>
    <p><p>
    <p style="color:#FFF;padding:2%">These statistics may impact development by letting the developer(s) understand what limits their apps may have or what to expect. In todays world the faster the better. People want the response times and data to be at their fingertips at lightning speeds. If your application requires loads of data, perhaps it would be best to not target the countries that are much slower than countries like Japan. In other words these statistics allow the developer to better know where to target what type of applications are made.<p>
    
    <p style="color: #FFFF00;padding:2%">7. And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</p>
    
    <p style="color:#FFF;padding-left:2%">I think like many in this industry the main target right now is gaming. I think part of the reason is that games are played by all age groups. Also games are more likely to be downloaded in devices that work with wifi only. Most gaming comes from Japan and the U.S. today so perhaps I would start there. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p style="color:#FFF;padding-left:2%">My second choice would probably be social networking. The main reason is because as we see today, social networking is not only for the public but for large business groups even. Both large and small or aspiring businesses, bands, artists and etc. are on todays social networks. They are always evolving and in need of keeping up with todays demands. Great place for advertisements which have recently become a large part of applications, or at least more apparent.</p>
